## 1. CDN List (Manual Process)

To rank and test a collection of CDNs we need a list of CDNs! 

This was gathered through some Googling and manual research
and then [PeeringDB](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/906) and [HackerTarget](https://hackertarget.com/as-ip-lookup/) were used
to associate each CDN with their ASN number. 

We store this list in `cdn_asn.csv`

Data Collection Date: 2025-07-06

## 2. ASN to IP Map

We then use the `cdn-asn-ip-map` Go program to covert all the CDN ASN numbers to a collection of IP addresses
which we dump as JSON to be used in a lookup table.

```shell
go run cmd/cdn-asn-ip-map/main.go
```

### Notes

Most of the code in this repo was generated by Jetbrains Junie AI Agent, it should be taken with a pinch of salt.
